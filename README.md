    Once we found a good computer repair shop to take the computer to, I immediately took it over. We picked Spotts Professional Computers. When I got there at about 5:30, the employee was very nice. He first asked what was going on with the computer, so I told him that when I turned the computer on, it immediately opened the command prompt, which in turn opened more command prompts, eventually shutting down the computer. He then quickly hooked the computer up to a monitor to check out the situation. Meanwhile, I filled out a piece of paper that asked for my personal information so they could contact me for any further information. He then told me the outrageous price to just LOOK at the computer, which was a base price of $79.99. He asked me how long the computer had been malfunctioning, so I told him I didn’t know. He asked if I had noticed any differences before today, and I told him I didn’t think so. Once the computer started up and started opening the command prompts, he looked super puzzled and even made the statement “well, this is strange”. He asked how long it took before the computer shut itself off, and I told him about 5-10 minutes. He kept working on the computer, and assured me that they would have it figured out by the next day, so I left. The next day, I received a phone call at about 12 o’clock to pick up the computer.
